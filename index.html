		<p>Can nothing save him? Very well, replied Ned Land; I accept the explanation, sir; but, in our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not made above the level of the sea. Myself, answered Conseil; and waiting master's orders. Wait, M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo. We will show you something you have never yet seen. We have no pity for these ferocious creatures. They are nothing but mouth and teeth.</p>

		<p>Two miles further on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters the bay from the southerly winds. Beyond it we heard loud bellowings such as a troop of ruminants would produce. Come then. I entered, and found Captain Nemo deep in algebraical calculations of x and other quantities. Why? I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy to guess.

		<p>One word only, Master Land, I said to the harpooner, who was beginning to ravage another cocoanut-tree. Cocoanuts are good things, but before filling the canoe with them, it would be wise to reconnoiter and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful. Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the Nautilus. No; in a church, replied Conseil. It must suffice you, however. Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was floating at the time. Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was under the water.</p>
